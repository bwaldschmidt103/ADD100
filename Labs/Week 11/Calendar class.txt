Objectives
Improving the student's skills in using the Calendar class.
Scenario
During this course, we looked at the Calendar class a bit. Your task is to extend its functionality with a new method called count_weekday_in_year, which takes a year and a weekday as parameters, and then returns the number of occurrences of a specific weekday in the year.

Use the following tips:

Create a class called MyCalendar that extends the Calendar class;
create the count_weekday_in_year method with the year and weekday parameters. The weekday parameter should be a value between 0-6, where 0 is Monday and 6 is Sunday. The method should return the number of days as an integer;
in your implementation, use the monthdays2calendar method of the Calendar class.
The following are the expected results:

Sample arguments

year=2019, weekday=0

Expected output

52


Sample arguments

year=2000, weekday=6

Expected output

53

import calendar

class MyCalendar(calendar.Calendar):
    def count_weekday_in_year(self, year, weekday):
        # Initialize a counter for the specified weekday
        count = 0
        
        # Iterate over each month in the year
        for month in range(1, 13):
            # Get the month's calendar as a list of weeks
            month_calendar = self.monthdays2calendar(year, month)
            
            # Iterate over each week in the month
            for week in month_calendar:
                # Check if the specified weekday occurs in the week
                for day, day_of_week in week:
                    if day_of_week == weekday and day != 0:
                        count += 1
        
        return count

# Example usage
my_calendar = MyCalendar()
print(my_calendar.count_weekday_in_year(2019, 0))  # Expected output: 52
print(my_calendar.count_weekday_in_year(2000, 6))  # Expected output: 53
