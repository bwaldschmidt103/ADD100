Objectives
improving the student's skills in operating with strings;
encouraging the student to look for non-obvious solutions.
Scenario
Do you know what a palindrome is?

It's a word which look the same when read forward and backward. For example, "kayak" is a palindrome, while "loyal" is not.

Your task is to write a program which:

asks the user for some text;
checks whether the entered text is a palindrome, and prints result.
Note:

assume that an empty string isn't a palindrome;
treat upper- and lower-case letters as equal;
spaces are not taken into account during the check - treat them as non-existent;
there are more than a few correct solutions - try to find more than one.
Test your code using the data we've provided.

Test data
Sample input:

Ten animals I slam in a net

Sample output:

It's a palindrome


Sample input:

Eleven animals I slam in a net

Sample output:

It's not a palindrome

    # Check if the cleaned text is equal to its reverse
    return cleaned_text == cleaned_text[::-1]

# Get input from user
text = input("Enter some text: ")

# Check if it's a palindrome

    print("The entered text is a palindrome.")
else:
    print("The entered text is not a palindrome.")
