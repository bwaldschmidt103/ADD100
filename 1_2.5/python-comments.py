#This program calculates the total miles per gallon. Essentially, it divids the distance by the tank size thus equalling the mpg.
tank_size = 15 #specifies the size of the tank
distance = 600 #this is the total distance
mpg = distance / tank_size  #program calculation
print("Miles per gallon:", mpg) #calculates the total miles per gallon
