Employee number
Create a subclass named ProductionWorker that inherits from Employee. This subclass should include additional attributes:

Shift number (integer: 1 for day, 2 for night)
Hourly pay rate
Implement accessor and mutator methods (getters and setters) for each class.

Assignment Part 2: Implementing and Testing
 

Part 2: Write a script to:

Create an instance of ProductionWorker.
Prompt the user for each attribute's data.
Store and then display the data using the object's methods.
